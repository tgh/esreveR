Unit Psuedo Code

(This block of psuedo code is for the 'run' routine for my "esreveR" LADSPA
plugin for cs410)

This is where the actual sound manipulation is performed.  It takes the given
block of samples and reverses smaller blocks of random sizes between 0.2
seconds and 1.5 seconds.  If the block sent in is less than 0.2 seconds in
length, then it is simply reversed.

if the total sample count is less than or equal to 1, then
	return

set an input reader to the beginning of the input buffer
set an output writer to the beginning of output buffer
set the minimum samples to reverse to 0.2 * the sample rate
set the maximum samples to reverse to 1.5 * the sample rate
set a start position to 0
set an input index to 0
set an output index to 0

while the output index has not reached the end of the output buffer, do
   set the random number lower bound to start position + minimum samples
   set the random number upper bound to start position + maximum samples

   if the random number lower bound is within minimum samples of the end of \
    the block or beyond the end of the block, then
      set the input index to one less than the last sample of the block
   end if

   else, then
      if the random number upper bound is within minimum samples away \
       from the end of the block, then
         set random number upper bound to the end of block minus minimum samples
      end if

      seed a random number generator with the current time
      get a random number between the random number lower and upper bounds
      set the input index to one less than the random number
   end if

   while the input index is not less than the start position
      set the output buffer's value at the output index to the input \
       buffer's value at the input index
      increment the output index
      decrement the input index
   end loop

   set the start position to the random number
end loop
