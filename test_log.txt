Test 1: 0 sample rate, 0 samples
	Result: Passed

Test 2: 44100 sample rate, 8000 samples (audio shorter than 0.2 seconds)
	Result: Segmentation Fault
	Error: Unsigned long underflow
	Fix: Added additional conditional to if statement
	Result: Passed

Test 3: 44100 sample rate, 30000 samples (audio longer than 0.2s, shorter than 1.5s)
	Result: Passed

Test 4: 44100 sample rate, 8820 samples (audio equal to 0.2s)
	Result: Passed

Test 5: 44100 sample rate, 66150 samples (audio equal to 1.5s)
	Result: Passed

Test 6: 44100 sample rate, 8821 samples (one sample longer than 0.2s)
	Result: Passed

Test 7: 44100 sample rate, 66151 samples (one sample longer than 1.5s)
	Result: Passed

Test 8: 48000 sample rate, 240000 samples (a normal example: 48kHz, 5s)
	Result: Unacceptable randomness, first two sub-blocks equal in length, then
			  next three sub-blocks equal in length
	Error: Unknown. Bad random number generator?  Bad seed, or seeded the same
			 in loop?  TEST AGAIN:
	Result: Passed, but error noted as bothersome/to be looked into.  TEST 9.
	-------
	Fix: Added a better seed algorithm using timeval with nanoseconds
	Result: Passed.  TEST AGAIN:
	Result: Passed

Test 9: 192000 sample rate, 2880000 samples (a very high example: 192kHz, 15s)
	Result: Unacceptable randomness, many successive blocks equal in length
	Error: Random number generator seeded in seconds, and since the random
			 numbers are generated in a loop that executes faster than a second,
			 the seed is the same, and thus the random number is the same.
	Fix: Added a better seed algorithm using timeval with nanoseconds
	Result: Random numbers differ, but they're favored towards upper bound

Test 10: 48000 sample rate, 240000 samples (normal example: 48kHz, 5s)
	Result: Passed, better randomness

Test 11: 48000 sample rate, 480000 samples (48kHz, 10s)
	Result: Passed, good randomness

Test 12: 44100 sample rate, 529200 samples (44.1kHz, 12s)
	Result: Passed, good randomness
