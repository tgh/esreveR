ESREVER (part of the StudioBlood LADSPA plugin package, hence the sb_ prefix)

esreveR is an audio plug-in using LADSPA (Linux Audio Developers Simple Programming API).
My first idea for a LADSPA plugin was to simply take a sound file and reverse it, because
to my surprise I didn't see any on the internet that performed such a simple effect.
But to my ignorance, pretty much all audio editing hosts already have that effect built-in.
Not only that, but LADSPA plugins are mainly for effects that act like guitar effects
pedals and can't take any entire file and manipulate it as such because the plugins use
blocks of samples rather than the whole sound file.

So this plugin takes each block of samples sent by the host, and reverses sub-blocks
of random sizes.  Not much practical use for this, but more of a random effect for
interest.

The name esreveR is just Reverse backwards if you didn't already catch that.

It is written in C with much help from Bart Massey, Tom Szilagyi, David Benson,
Dave Phillips, and Richard Furse--the source file(s) provide the official
thanks and acknowledgements.

This plug-in can be used with any audio program that supports LADSPA plug-ins.
See your favorite audio program's specifications to see if it supports LADSPA
plug-ins.  I used Audacity to test the plugin, but will most likely use Ardour
as my primary audio tool.

I am still a student programmer at the time of this writing, so some of the comments
in the source code are detailed and directed at the beginner as well.  Hopefully
the comments will be beneficial to those who were like me in learning the API,
and not too annoying for the pro's out there.

To install, make sure the LADSPA_PATH variable in the Makefile is correct to your
environment, and just run (as root) make install.
